.SH NAME
SaX2 \- SuSE advanced X11 configuration,
a complete module based X11 configurator

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sax2
[
.I options 
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
SaX2 is a program to configure the X-Server. It is able to detect almost
all stuff related to the graphics card. The graphics card, Touchscreens,
Tablets, 3D features, AccessX, Keyboard, Mouse, Multihead, ... and more
can be configured using this tool.

.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
Available command line options are the following:
.TP
-b \fI[filename,filename,...]\fP
Activate the SaX2 batch modus. If no filename is given an interactive
shell is started to set/overwrite configuration parameters. If the filename
doesn't contain any / characters it is assumed to be found in /usr/share/sax/profile.
.TP
-b \fIXinerama | MergedFB\fP
Special call for -b, if Xinerama is specified SaX2 will automatically
search for a profile to enable dualhead in old Xinerama style. If MergedFB
is specified SaX2 will automatically search for a dualhead profile to
activate dualhead using merged framebuffer.
.TP
-a
Auto configure modus. Create an automatic configuration without any
needed user interaction and GUI.
.TP
-l
Enable low resolution. Allow only the 800x600 resolution for the
graphics setup. This is usefull if the DDC probing of the monitor results
in not displayable resolution values.
.TP
-m \fIcard X=module,card X=module,...\fP
Set driver module to use for card
.I X
You can specify one driver module for each card detected.
.TP
-c \fIchip,chip,...\fP
Set chip to use for configuration. The
.I -p
option show all available chip numbers and you can select the
one you want to use for the configuration.
.TP
-d \fIdisplay\-number\fP
Set the display manually instead of probing the next free one.
This is only usefull if SaX2 was started from a text console.
.TP
-x
Use server build in Modelines. This will prevent SaX2 from calculating
its own modelines. The server build in mode pool is used instead.
This will only work for VESA specified resolutions.
.TP
-u
Use server mode suggestion. This will prevent SaX2 from suggesting
a resolution used for the configuration. The server itself will decide
the best resolution to use than.
.TP
-p
Show PCI/AGP information about the detected graphics card(s)
.TP
-n \fInode\fP
Set device node to use for the core pointer. This will specify the
port the mouse is connected to. For serial mice use /dev/ttySX where X is
the port number of the serial device, for USB devices use /dev/input/mice
and for PS/2 devices use /dev/psaux.
.TP
-t \fItype\fP
Set protocol type to use for the core pointer.
.TP
-g
Use gpm as repeater of mouse events.
.TP
-s
This option only takes effect if SaX2 has to start its own X-Server.
It will than use the system installed config file instead of the
HW detection data.
.TP
--vesa
This option will set a given resolution and vertical sync
value (in Hz) as VESA standard resolution for a specific
card. Please note if you set a resolution smaller than 800x600
the graphics user interface won't fit the screen dimensions.
The format is the following:
.I Card:XxY@VSync
Example: 0:1024x768@85
.TP
--sysconfig
this option tell SaX2 to import the system wide
config file even if SaX2 was started from a textconsole
which normaly will import the SaX2 HW detection data
.TP
--fullscreen
start in fullscreen mode
.TP
-i
This option will disable the use of profiles which are normally applied
automatically if defined for a specifc card or chipset
.TP
-r
Remove detection database and re-init the hardware database
.TP
-v
print version information and exit.
