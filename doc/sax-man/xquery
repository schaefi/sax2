.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
Available command line options are the following:
.TP
-s

single space,
.I screen
define which screen should be used to apply the new timing and
.I timing
specify the new timing values. Timing parameters are the following:

1. Horizontal display value

.SH NOTE
xquery take care about Xinerama sessions. This means even if you have
only one big screen, xquery will know about the single screens
building this big screen. Unfortunately there are Xinerama or similar 
extensions built into binary drivers like nvidia which are not handled
correctly via xquery.
