.SH NAME
xmode \- Calculate X11 Modelines

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xmode
[
.I options 
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
xmode calculates X11 modelines according to your specifications
the output from xmode contains three lines where the first line
print the horizontal sync value in
.I Khz
and the second line the refresh rate in
.I Hz
The third and last line is the modeline to be used within the
.I /etc/X11/xorg.conf
file

.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
Available command line options are the following:
.TP
-d \fIdacspeed\fP
RamDac speed to use for the Modeline
.TP
-r \fIrefresh rate in Hz\fP
Set basic refresh rate to use for the Modeline
.TP
-s \fIhorizontal sync rate in Khz\fP
Set basic fhorizontal sync rate to use for the Modeline
.TP
-x \fIX dimension in pixels\fP
Set X resolution
.TP
-y \fIY dimension in pixels\fP
Set Y resolution
.TP
-n
Do not call the check geometry algorithm. This algorithm tries
to put the image to the center but this will change the basic
values for refresh\- and/or horizontal sync rate. If you want
the modeline to be exactly at the given frequencies use this
option.
.TP
-f
Calculate Framebuffer modes instead of X11 modes which can be
used with a
.I fbset
call, if the kernel framebuffer is able to swtich the mode
