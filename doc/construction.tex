\chapter{The SaX2 Principle, based on X11 R6, Version 4.x}
\label{cha:dsp}
\minitoc
SaX2 is based on a three-layered model which was
developed for configuring X11. Briefly outlined, a registration of
hardware is performed in the first layer, in the second layer the actual
configuration takes place, which can either be completely automated or be
done manually, using the information gathered up till now. The third layer
serves to optimize the position and size of the image, after a successful
configuration and start of the X server.

As a result, the first layer will create a cache file which is the so called
\textbf{registry} stored as \textit{/var/cache/sax/files/config} which is
then imported from the second
layer to create the initial configuration suggestion. Up to this point
a common formatted interface named \textbf{ISaX} serves as proxy between
the configuration data and the program using the data. ISaX is able to
provide a common interface between the cache data gathered up till now and
the data contained in an eventually existing configuration file
\textit{/etc/X11/xorg.conf}. ISaX is also able to receive data, of the same
format as it is abel to provide, to create or modify the actual configuration
file. The program using the data only needs to create such an interface
file and request \textbf{isax} to create the X11 configuration. Using the
interface more comfortable can be done by using the development
library called \textbf{libsax}. The registry in combination with the
first and second level processes as well as all the perl Modules for the
purposes of importing and exporting data is named the \textbf{SaX2 engine}

This approach allows the graphical interface to be developed in a completely
transparent manner. In this case it also doesn't matter with what means
this was created. Whether this was done with ncurses, Tk, Qt or whatever it
is based on, you must only ensure that the result of the configuration is 
either an ISaX interface file matching the corresponding format or use libsax
if available in your destination language. The format of the interface is
described in appendix ~\ref{cha:api}.

The implementation of SaX2 is based on the languages 
\textbf{C++} and \textbf{Perl}. Many small tools, for adjusting the mouse, for
example, or for parsing various formats, were implemented in C. For reasons of
performance, the storage and the re-reading of the hardware registration was
also implemented in C. The principle and procedure of the configuration,
writing the configuration file and the GUI which SaX2 itself suggests, were
implemented in Qt.

\index{init.pl}
\section{Level 1: Init}
\label{sec:le1}
Init is represented by  \textbf{init.pl} and takes on the following tasks:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Creating the principle file structure and determining default settings.
\item Detection of hardware with reference to PCI/PCI-E/AGP graphics cards,
  pointer devices, keyboard and monitor. The actual hardware scan is started
  by a sysp (System-Profiler) call-up. Sysp is an independent program which is
  given its functionality through insertable modules, which in turn can take on
  a specific task. In the case of SaX2, only modules were developed for
  detecting the above-mentioned components. A description of the individual
  modules can be found in chapter ~\ref{cha:sys}.
\item Entry of data into the hardware registry. By means of functions from the
  perl module \textit{AutoDetect.pm}, the information provided by sysp is
  integrated into the file structure. The result from default settings and
  hardware data corresponds to the hardware registry.
\item Saving the registry. The registration data is then saved in its current
  form as a binary stream in \textit{/usr/share/sax/files/config}. 
\end{itemize}

init.pl is usually not called up manually but via a startup script, described
at the end of this chapter. There, all available options are listed in
detail. It is always necessary to run init.pl whenever hardware has been
changed, whether by inserting another graphics card, or just changing the
mouse. In normal cases the hardware registry is only created once, which
considerably speeds up the starting of SaX2. 

\index{xc.pl}
\section{Level 2: XC}
\label{sec:le2}
XC (X-Configuration) is represented by xc.pl and 
takes over the following tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reading the hardware registry. Reading in the registry is done very
      quickly, since the data has already been saved in the form of a hash. Data
      can thus be read in directly to a perl hash and processed further. 
\item By means of the functions from \textit{CreateSections.pm}, 
      a first automatic X11 file is created from the hardware registry. If 
      no X server is running this configuration is then used to start the
      server. In this case the user is prompted with an information about
      a first configuration suggestion. If the user is satisfied with
      this configuration he can simply save it and no further configuration
      tool needs to be started otherwise the user can start the SaX2 GUI or
      abort the configuration. If there is a server running already,
      xc will start the SaX2 GUI directly and import the actual configuration
	  file. The mode tuning is supported by a perl module with the name
      \textit{XFineControl.pm}. This module is used in SaX2/libsax, since the
      actual program \textit{xfine} which makes changes to the screen,
      merely protocols the changes to the modeline in
	  \textit{/var/cache/xfine/...}. The exact structure of the files
      in \textit{/var/cache/xfine/} and how xfine functions is described
      in chapter ~\ref{cha:xfi}.
\item Starting the graphical interface. The interface itself in turn makes use
      of the data stored in the hardware registry.
      Depending on whether an already existing configuration file should be
      read in or not, either data is used from the registry, or information
      from the configuration file. Encapsulated into the \textbf{ISaX}
      interface the following tasks can be done. The reading in of an already
      existing configuration file is done by a perl module called
      \textit{ParseConfig.pm}. This module represents an extension of the 
      Perl interpreter and is based on the \textbf{libxf86config.a}, which is
      included from version 4.x of X11 R6. The graphical interface itself
      only has the task of creating a Variables-API file, from which an
      X11 configuration file is newly created, through a later import, using
      the \textit{ImportAPI.pm} module in conjunction with the
      \textit{CreateSections.pm} module. Another possibility of creating
	  the Variables-API file is using the methods from libsax. libsax
      hides all the tasks of creating the Variables-API file and calling
      \textbf{isax} within a high level C++ library. More information
	  about libsax can be found in chapter ~\ref{cha:libsax}.
      In case of testing the newly created X11 configuration the
      file is used to start a second instance of the X server. On this server
      the tuning tool xfine is started, to be able to make possible changes in
      position and size.
\end{itemize}

\index{xw}
\section{xw}
\label{sec:xw}
In the SaX2 running procedure there are a number of points at which one or
more X servers need to be started. Starting a new server is always done by the
\textbf{xw} program.
This program was originally a Perl script, later replaced by a C program. The
name \textit{xw} is derived from \textbf{xw}rapper. The program fulfills the
following tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Starting the X server in its own process. Here the first option is
      interpreted as the logfile name, the remaining options are passed on to
	  the X server. The server is started in a process created by xw through
      fork(). The output of the X server in the child process, which is written
      to the STDERR channel, is diverted to the logfile by a freeopen() call.
      xw itself ( father ) remains in the foreground and waits. 
\item Only when the SIGUSR1 signal has been received, which is sent by the X
      server to the calling process, is the server ready to work. If the signal
      arrives, then the father process is ended, whilst the child process ( X
      server ) continues to function. The process number of the child process is
      here output to STDOUT.
\item Set up background picture and surrounding corner marks
\end{itemize}

\index{options}
\section{Startup Script}
\label{sec:sta}
The coordination of the processes \textbf{init.pl} and \textbf{xc.pl}
is controlled by the startup script \textit{sax.sh}, 
which is located in \textit{/usr/sbin} and is usually called up by the 
wrapper script \textit{/usr/sbin/SaX2}. The wrapper here takes over the
following tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Creating a secure, temporary directory with \textbf{mktemp}. 
\item Testing for root permissions. If a normal user calls up the program,
      then authentication is required. This is done by the xauth mechanism, via
      the  \textit{sux} command, or via the xhost mechanism, if sux does not
      exist. In both cases the root password has to be given.  
\item Calling up the actual SaX2 startup script, \textbf{/usr/sbin/sax.sh}
\end{itemize}
The ability to pass on options to the startup script is provided by the sum of
options from init.pl and xc.pl. The following options are available:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb+-b | --batchmode <interactive|profile>+\\
      With this option the so-called batch mode is activated.
      In this case SaX2 will not start immediately, but depending on the
      parameters, will open an interactive shell or allow the input of data
      from STDIN. Starting a shell is done via the optional parameter 
      \textit{interactive}, with \textit{profile} SaX2 awaits data from STDIN. 
      The batch mode allows it to access the configuration procedure directly. 
      Changes in the batch mode are also stored in the registry.
      The batch mode requires data to be in a special format. This format is
      briefly described if you enter \textit{help}. It is very important,
      however, to understand what changes were made, and where. Examples of
      using the interactive shell and the STDIN mode can be found in Appendix
      A. 
      
\item \verb+-a | --auto+\\
      With this option the automatic configuration is started. This means that
      SaX2 works in the background and creates an automatic configuration from
      the current registry data. In this case, no X server or  
      configuration interface is started. 

\item \verb+-l | --lowres+\\
      With this option the DDC detection is switched off. This means that
      possible information provided by the monitor on its resolution options
      will not be used. SaX2 will then start in 800x600 VGA mode.

\item \verb+-m | --modules+\\
      With this option, a server module can be assigned for each graphics
      chip. An example should illustrate its use:
      \begin{verbatim}
         sax2 -m 0=vga,2=mga 
      \end{verbatim}
      Chip 0 is assigned to the vga module and chip 2 to the mga module. Which
      chip number matches which card can be seen with the option -p. 
      
\item \verb+-c | --chip+\\
      With this option you can determine which chipsets should be used for
      configuration. For graphics cards with just one graphics processor,
      this option is the same as the number of graphics cards to be
      used:
      \begin{verbatim}
         sax2 -c 0,2
      \end{verbatim}
      Use the cards with the chips 0 and 2. It should be especially noted that
      the option -c changes the order of module allocations. If, for example,
      cards 0 and 2 out of 3 graphics cards are to be used, and here the
      modules for these cards are also to be set by options, then this will be
      given as follows: 
      \begin{verbatim} 
         sax2 -c 0,2 -m 0=vga,1=mga
      \end{verbatim}
      The sequence of module allocation always increases by a step of one.

\item \verb+-p | --pci+\\
      With this information, SaX2 outputs the result of the PCI/PCI-E/AGP
      detection. The output is important in determining which chip number
      was assigned to which graphics card.

\item \verb+-d | --display < Display-Number >+\\
      With this option the number of the display to be used can be defined. It
      should be noted here that this does not denote the format of an X
      display, but just a number. If SaX2 is to be started on display 5, then
      the command will be as follows:
      \begin{verbatim} 
         sax2 -d 5
      \end{verbatim} 
      
\item \verb+-x | --xmode+\\
      This option instructs SaX2 not to calculate any modelines. In 
      this case the modelines installed in the X server will be used to start
      SaX2.

\item \verb+-u | --automode+\\
      This option instructs the server to search for the best mode
      itself. This means that SaX2 does not write any resolution to the start
      configuration, but leaves this to the server to choose the mode.

\item \verb+-n | --node+\\  
      With this option the device node for the main mouse cursor can be set.

\item \verb+-t | --type+\\
      With this  option the protocol to be used for the main mouse cursor
      is given. 

\item \verb+-g | --gpm+\\
      This option activates the gpm as a repeater. Then SaX2 uses 
      \textit{MouseSystems} as the mouse protocol and as the device node, the
      fifo \textit{/dev/gpmdata} provided by GPM.\\
      \textbf{NOTE:} Currently this option does not work for X1 R6 v4.0-based
      X servers.

\item \verb+-s | --sysconfig+\\
      this option tell SaX2 to import the system wide config file even
      if SaX2 was started from a textconsole which normaly will import
      the SaX2 HW detection data

\item \verb+--vesa+\\
      This  option will set a given resolution and vertical sync value
      (in Hz) as VESA standard resolution for  a  specific  card.  The
      format is the following: \textbf{Card:XxY@VSync Example: 0:1024x768@85}

\item \verb+--fullscreen+\\
      start in fullscreen mode

\item \verb+-i | --ignoreprofile+\\
      This option will disable the use of profiles which are normally
      applied automatically if defined for a specifc card or chipset

\item \verb+-r | --reinit+\\
      Remove detection database and re-init the hardware database

\item \verb+-v | --version+\\
      print version information and exit.
\end{itemize}
